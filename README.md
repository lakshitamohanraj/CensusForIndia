## Problem statement 
## An Approach to smart census in india 
- Lots of enumerators are struggling to travel and walk to each houses to get the householding and house related details from residents . To make it easier for them to reduce the manual work
  we have approached the problem with an app 
## About the project
The proposed system introduces an app which digitalises the work of the staffs involved in the work of taking census.
Our app has comprehensive solution for streamlined census-taking! In an era driven by data, it empowers communities, governments, and organizations with a user-friendly platform designed to efficiently collect, manage, and analyze demographic information.
With intuitive features and advanced capabilities, it revolutionizes the traditional census process, ensuring accuracy, accessibility, and inclusivity for all stakeholders.

The app can able to authenticate the user through otp , email and password . 
Two roles - Enumerator and public User
The public user can enter the details related to house and submit it to the enumerators through app itself

## Technical implemntaion 
By leveraging the open source Flutter framework and fireBase Tools was helpful in developing the app 
- Flutter : Helps to develope andriod apps and has many faciities to make the UI , functioning of modules
- FireBase : Stores all the user entered data in the cloud and display it to the enumerator
- FireBase Auth: Helps to authenticate the right user through OTP , email id ,passwords
- 

## Techstacks used 
`Flutter` , `Firebase` , ``fireBaseAuth , `Dart programming` , `Kotlin`

## How to run locally 
Install FLutter in you system 
and go to main.dart file under the file directory and run command
```
flutter run
```
# What's next ?
We are in the learning process of the flutter framework and its tools
- In future we want to make the app more secured by integrating the app with Face detection and bio metrics authentication'
- We also want to improve the awareness of the app to the public user , by telling how important is to make the census
- the above can be achieved by interfacing with a notification system
